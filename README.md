# Embedded C++ Engineer Roadmap
This repository should serve as a guide to anyone who wants to study software and hardware for embedded systems but doesn't know where to start.

## Objective
I plan to compile and elucidate a comprehensive set of topics within this repository. The objective is to provide detailed explanations and insights into each of these subjects, offering learners a thorough understanding of key concepts. The repository will serve as an educational resource, breaking down complex topics into accessible explanations and providing a structured approach for individuals looking to delve into the world of embedded systems and C++. The goal is to create a valuable reference point for both beginners and intermediate learners, facilitating a clear and guided learning path.

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## Overarching goals 
- ## Fundamental Proficiency:
  ### Goal: 
  Acquire a solid understanding of embedded systems fundamentals and microcontroller architecture.
  ### Indicators of Success: 
  Demonstrate the ability to write simple programs for a chosen microcontroller platform, understanding memory organization, and basic I/O operations.
- ## Modern C++ Mastery:
  ### Goal:
  Achieve proficiency in C++ with a focus on features relevant to embedded systems.
  ### Indicators of Success:
  Write clean and efficient C++ code, demonstrate understanding of resource constraints, and apply features like constexpr and static_assert.

## study subjects
  - ### Software
    - Programming languages (basic and advanced subjects), like C/C++
        - We will talk about modern C++
    - Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
    - Data Structure
    - Algorithms
    - Bare-metal programming
    - RTOS Knowledge (Real-time operating systems)
    - Bits manipulation
    - DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
  - ## Hardware
    - Digital Logic
    - Hardware architecture (Arduino MCU among others)
    - Core (CPU, Registers, Bus, Cache, Flash/SRAM/DRAM memories)
    - Microcontrollers interface (e.g AVR Programming or Arm Cortex)
    - Features and peripherals (GPIO, PWM, Clock, Watchdog, ADC, DMA, EEPROM, RTC, etc)
    - Comunication Protocols (UART, IÂ²C, SPI)
    - Understand WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and others
    - Interrupters, Timers, Counters
    - Datasheet reading
    - PCB Design

## General Content
Here I'll put some content that are useful, not only for studying but also implementing and practicing in real life projects.
